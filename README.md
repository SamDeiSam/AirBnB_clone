# AirBnB

## Project Description

This team project is part of the ALX Full-Stack Software Engineer program.
This is the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone.
This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects.

Each task is linked and will help you to:

- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

## Description of the command interpreter

Its exactly the same as the shell but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

### How to start it, How to use it, with Examples.
**Execution**
The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell.
It prints a prompt **(hbnb)** and waits for the user for input.

Command | Example
------- | -------
Run the console | ```./console.py```
Quit the console | ```(hbnb) quit```
Display the help for a command | ```(hbnb) help <command>```
Create an object (prints its id)| ```(hbnb) create <class>```
Show an object | ```(hbnb) show <class> <id>``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.show(<id>)```
Destroy an object | ```(hbnb) destroy <class> <id>``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.destroy(<id>)```
Show all objects, or all instances of a class | ```(hbnb) all``` or ```(hbnb) all <class>```
Update an attribute of an object | ```(hbnb) update <class> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, "<attribute value>")```

Non-interactive mode example

```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update
```
